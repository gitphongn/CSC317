Description:
I started with writing the html for the calculator first, moved on to the css for it, and then finalize it with the javascript. I decided to make my calculator buttons by using the input element. I approach the html for it by doing organizing my code into rows. I do it this way to visually see how the display will turn out when I am coding the css portion of the calculator. The javascript portion was the most trickiest especially when updating the display correctly.
