Analysis:
This assignment required me to create four CSS approaches for the same portfolio HTML. Hand-written CSS provided the most control but was time-consuming. I did had to go and did some online research to see how some of the elements and property works. Hand-written did get a little confusing of how the property works and how it will affect the actual page itself. AI-generated CSS offered creative ideas but needed refinement. Comparing the AI to my hand-written one, the code for it seemed more shorter and straightforward while my hand-written one seems more spaced out. The hybrid approach combined AI's creativity with manual optimization. Each method produced distinct visual results, highlighting CSS's power in transforming a website without altering its HTML. 

Through this process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the flexibility of CSS and the trade-offs between different approaches. While AI assistance sped up the process and provided inspiration, it sometimes lacked precision, requiring manual adjustments to achieve the desired outcome. On the other hand, fully hand-written CSS allowed for meticulous customization but took more effort and troubleshooting. The hybrid method struck a balance, making it easier to refine and improve styling efficiently. This assignment helped me understand not just the technical aspects of CSS but also the importance of workflow efficiency in web development.

Lessons Learned:
What I learned is it's important to make sure you double check the selector's name from your css with your html or else there could be some mistakes and it won't update the page. I did faced that a few times so I was able to gain the habit of checking back and forth with my html and css to see if I typed it correctly. 

Preferred Version:
I would prefer the hybrid version because I was able to combined a snippet of AI and my own hand-written to make something more unique. It looks more clean and natural to my own liking. Hybrid version also allowed me to be more creative.
