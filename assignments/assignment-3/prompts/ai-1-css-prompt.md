Please create a simple CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by "piano" look and feel. I'm a student learning CSS basics and need styling for the following sections: 

Navigation bar
Header/intro section
About me section
Education section
Projects section
Contact form
Footer

I'd like my website to have the colors, style, and mood that remind people of "winter". Make sure the layout is responsive for mobile and desktop screens. Please add helpful comments that explain what different parts of the CSS do. 

Some specific things I'd like:

A color scheme based on "winter" 
Easy-to-read fonts
Some simple hover effects on buttons and links
Basic responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
Reasonable spacing between elements
Please also remove any bullet points
Structure neatly
make the table look nicer
Add some effects
Center images
