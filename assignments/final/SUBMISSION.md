Final Project

## Reflection
Working in a group setting was quite challenging depending on the coordination my group have. My group had a good amount of coordination 
where one person focus on the backend, one focus on the frontend, and others on the documentation and error handling. Some of us were confused on some parts
but we were able to figure it out by saying what we think and testing it out either way. Our time management was a bit off, where we spent our time on something more heavy in 
a short amount of time, especially the backend. One of my group mate had some experiences with backend so they were able to help us figure out what we need. 
One main takeaway that I have is that it's important to keep things organize and labeled well to know where which files direct to which so you don't end up
finding it yourself which is very time consuming. Overall, I enjoy this project and it really showed my understanding with HTML, CSS, Javascript and ejs.
