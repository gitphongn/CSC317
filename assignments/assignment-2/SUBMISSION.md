HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment Description:
-	This assignment is demonstrating the skills I have learned from HTML and implementing it by making a Portfolio Webpage. The goal of this assignment is to make a webpage showing my own skills and ability by using HTML basic tags to more advanced tags like iframes and form. 

My Approach:
-	The way I approach this assignment is by parts. I would split it into different parts so I could manage to understand and code what I need to show. I started off by making different sections that are required for the assignment then slowly fill in the sections with necessary codes. Knowing HTML, the page source should start with title then header, body, and footer for the general idea. I eventually fill in those segments after.

Code Explanation:

<header>
    <h1> Phong Nguyen </h1>
</header>
<h2> San Francisco State University  </h2> <br>
<img src="images/sfsu-logo.jpg" width= 200 alt="San Francisco State University Logo"> <br>
<img src="images/SF-city.webp" width= 200 alt="San Francisco city">

Looking at this code, I have the header and using h1 tag to show that this is what I want at the top and with the title big. Moving below that is the tag h2, which I used for displaying my schoolâ€™s name. Below that are the image tags I used to display the images I want on my page. The image tags include the source of the image, the width, and a short description of what the image is.
