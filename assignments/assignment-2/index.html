            My name is Phong Nguyen, currently a student at San Francisco State University. This is my portfolio to showcase my skills and projects I have done within my own time 
            and classes at University. I see myself as curious and dependable when it comes to who I am. These traits can boost my ability to program webpages such as this portfolio 
            and show that I aim for a well detailed and organized format to show users what I am capable of. Feel free to explore the links below.
