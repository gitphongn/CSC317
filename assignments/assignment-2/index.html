            My name is Phong Nguyen, currently a student at San Francisco State University. This is my portfolio to showcase my skills and 
            projects I have done within my own time and classes at University. I see myself as curious and dependable when it comes to who I am. 
            These traits can boost my ability to program webpages such as this portfolio and show that I aim for a well detailed and 
            organized format to show users what I am capable of. I believe that I can expand and develop my knowledge even further with 
            what I am commited to as a computer science student. Feel free to explore the links below.
