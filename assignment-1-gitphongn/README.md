Welcome to your first homework assignment.

Take lots of screen shots as you complete each step!

Edit the home.html file in the public/ directory. The minimum requirements are that it display your name, the date, and a picture of your choice. 

All the files are served by NodeJS using express and are in the "public/" subfolder located in the same direactory as server317.js, (put your image file in public/).

You are welcome to add more to the page if you wish.

The HTML to add an image (and specifically I want you to use) is: 

     <img src=YOUR_IMAGE.jpg width=300><br>

This HTML specifies that you want to include an image, and the source file for that image is YOUR_IMAGE.jpg, and that you want the image scaled in size so that the width is 300 pixels wide. 

The HTML command `<br>` will cause a line break.

To view the webpage, you need to start NodeJS by opening a terminal window and going to your git project directory and running the command `node server317.js` form your github repo directory.  Then open the firefox web browser in the virtual machine (not your host computer) and go the the URL: `http://localhost:3000/`

Have fun with the assignment as you create and serve your own web page. 

When complete, take a screen shot or photo that you will include in a PDF.

Use the provided CSC317 Writeup Template for all your writeups, located at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rcxi6R4lIImDE1Ey_EkkPVjMBODSXvJGbWM63ZfDgUY/edit

The PDF file (your writeup) should be comprised of 5 sections (and don't forget your name and student ID number and the class on the paper):

    Description of the assignment
    Approach  A  writeup of the steps you took to complete the assignment (strategy and plan)
    What issues did you have and how did you overcome them
    Analysis:  (Reflect on what you have learned and how decisions made could impact users.)
    The screen shots of the linux installation and your final webpage.

The PDF you will submit in Canvas for this assignment.

Please remember, this is the most critical assignment, because this is the environment we will use for the rest of the semester.
